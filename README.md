## Node client

Apache Pulsar Node.js sample clients

Since Node.js library depends on Pulsar C++ library, please install C++ library as prerequisite. Download RPM or DEB packages from [Apache distribution archive](https://archive.apache.org/dist/pulsar/) Both pulsar-client and pulsar-client-dev packages are required. Current Pulsar Node.js depends on C++ version 2.4 and higher.

## Node Websocket

Websocket client does not have C++ library dependency.
